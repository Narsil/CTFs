# [20 Points] Tear Or Dear [by Thiseas] 
The logic of the binary is very simple, there is no any cryptography or obfuscation here just some functions.

# [20 Points] Find The Easy Pass [by Thiseas]
the whole idea here is before jumping to wrong or correct status, it stores our input in eax and the password in ebx registers .. after this step there is jump if not zero which will check if eax is equal ebx so all we have to do is to know what is the value of ebx.

# [30 Points] Impossible Password [by decoder]
We got a crackme named impossible password, we have to input two correct passwords in order to get the flag ..
the first password is ```SuperSeKretKey``` as we can see in plaintext.

the second password is generated by an algorithm located in ```sub_40078D```

here we can clearly see that the password will never be the same as our input so as the hint says  ``` Are you able to cheat me and get the flag?  ```  we have to use the noobie way and just change the execution flow to get the flag.
